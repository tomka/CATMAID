"""
This is a custom version of the postgresql_psycopg2 adaptor that
overrides last_insert_id so that it works with inherited tables.
Instead of using pg_get_serial_sequence, this finds the default value
of the primary key for the table and parse out the sequence name from
that.

As of May 2015 this is still required: It replaces last_insert_id, a
function that returns the last ID of a sequence. The implementation in
Django 1.6.11 and more recent versions (like 1.8.2) does the following:

  SELECT CURRVAL(pg_get_serial_sequence(tablename, pk_name))

Unfortunately, in Postgres 9.4 (and I assume in earlier versions, too)

  pg_get_serial_sequence(tablename, pk_name)

can't work with sequences defined in parent tables if inheritance is
used. CATMAID uses table inheritance and Django this Postgres function.
So it has to be worked around this problem.

Performance-wise, this should not be a big problem. this extra query is
also done in Django's version (even if in a much simpler version). The
function last_insert_id is only used for insert statements through the
ORM.
